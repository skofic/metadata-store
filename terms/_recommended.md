# `_recommended`

**`_title`**

Recommended properties

**`_definition`**

Selection of recommended properties.

**`_description`**

This field contains a [descriptors selection rule](_selection-descriptors.md) that determines which *set* of *descriptors* are *recommended* to be *included* in the [data structure definition](_type_object.md) of the *object*. By *recommended* it means that you are *strongly encouraged* to *include* the *selection* of *properties* in the *object*.

The selection *values* must be the [global identifier](_gid.md) of the *descriptors* that are *recommended*.

If these properties are not added to the object this doesn't mean that the object is invalid.

**`_examples`**

```json
	"_selection-descriptors_one": [one, two, three],
	"_selection-descriptors_any": [red, green, blue],
	"_selection-descriptors_all": [mon. tue, wed]
}
```

This selection rule implies the following conditions:

- At least *one* of `[red, green, blue]` is recommended.
- *One* or *more* of `[odd, even] `are recommended.
- *All* of `[mon, tue, wed]` are recommended.
